# Deep-Learning-Fundementals

In this repository, ComVIS Lab Team is going to share fundemental functions and fundemental algorithms used in Deep Learning Models.

In Deep Learning Fundementals, the following modules are important.
We are going to give all the necessary details in our repository with supporting all
materials & Python Codes with their references.

- <a href="https://github.com/Comvislab/Deep-Learning-Fundementals/tree/main/Activation%20Functions#activation-functions"> Activation Functions (ReLU, Parameterized ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)</a>
- Simple Linear Regression (A Neuron concept) Ex:Gold Price Prediction
- Polynomial Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression with Regularization L2
- Lasso Regression with Regularization L1
- Logistic Regression
- MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron)
- Backpropagation Neural Nets
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Net 
- LeNet5, AlexNET, VGG16/19
- ResNet
- Inception

We are going to update our repository according to the plan 
that we have given above..
Please follow us to learn all the fundementals..
With my pleasure.
